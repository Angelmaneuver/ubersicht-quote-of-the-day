## Settings

### Refresh time

A request is made every 6 hours, this is because I am not connected all day long so this make sure that the quote is updated everyday. You might want to set it to higher number

	// the refresh frequency in milliseconds
	// 21600000 = every 6h Default
	// 43200000 = every 12h
	// 86400000 = every 24h / day
	export const refreshFrequency = 21600000;

### Quote

The plugin use the public API no need for a key, the is retrieve from a category. The default is **Funny**

Edit the file to set key of your desired category
here are the predefined categories: **"death", "love", "life", "funny", "inspire", "art"**
	
	const current_category = categries[3]; //start at 0-5
	
<s> #### Default</s>

<s>A default quote is set if no quote are return and the localStorage is empty</s>

- <s>*Never stop being a good person because of bad people*</s>

### Appearance

For white backgrounds, uncomment this line in the css class, increase the alpha to your liking:
```background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)``` will be dark enough to be readable.
**Note**: There is now minimum background color by default.

	.quote-of-the-day::before 
	{
		//background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
	}
	
If you use a different background for each mode like Darkish wallpaper when in Dark mode the text-color will be white & the opposite when using a white like wallpaper in Light mode

uncomment this part to enable it, if you made your quote background a lot more darker you probably don't need
	
	/*@media(prefers-color-scheme: light) {
		color: #444444;
		
		.title {
			color: #888888;
		}
		.author {
			color: #666666;
		}
	}*/
Edit the position by changing these settings:
	
	bottom: 100px;
	left: 0;
	
To change the width of the container change this part according to your need

	.quote-of-the-day-container {
		margin: 0 auto;
		max-width: 960px;// no make it wider or narrowed
	}
	
<s>You can remove the line above by commenting line **97**, I use it to delimiter my clock widget</s>

	<hr>


#### Quote image

Comment line ** to hide the image

	<img className="image" src={image}/>
	
## Disclamer

I am not a react developer so, the widget might not be optimize I just edit the default file and throw in some Vanilla JavaScript.
I use localStorage to limit the amount of request to the end point and to have the quote even when the network is down.

## To Do

- [x] Automatically set a random category every day
- [ ] Add a button (Hidden) somewhere on the widget to show a drop down list on click and manually set the category in interactive mode
- [ ] Errors handling
- [ ] A fancy desing (maybe)ðŸ˜ƒ
